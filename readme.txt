= I am not getting emails from the ChatBot =
The ChatBot uses the WordPress' default email function. If you are not getting emails from the ChatBot's email feature, it is likely that no emails are getting through from your WordPress site or they are ending up in the Spam box. Try using an SMTP mailer plugin.


= The ChatBot is NOT working in the front end. =
The most common reason for this is if the theme is coded incorrectly and jQuery is loaded from external source. jQuery is included with WordPress core and according to WordPress standard, jQuery must be included using wp_enqueue_script. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/ . Please make sure if that is the case in your theme.
